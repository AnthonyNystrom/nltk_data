Whereas this converter will list the root (the head of the sentence, and not a dummy root symbol) as having index 1, these have been modified to match CoNLL format (http://nextens.uvt.nl/~conll/example.html) where the root has index 0.  Use of this data must obey all conditions applicable to the LDC corpus it is build from, and is for non-commercial use only."
